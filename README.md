## Example Usages
### Simple EC2-OpenVPN
The following example demonstrates the basic usage of the ec2-openvpn module:

```hcl
module "ec2-openvpn" {
  source = "rizkiprass/ec2-openvpn-as/aws"

  name                          = "Openvpn Access Server"
  create_ami                    = true
  create_vpc_security_group_ids = true
  instance_type                 = "t3.micro"
  key_name                      = ""
  vpc_id                        = aws_vpc.vpc.id
  ec2_subnet_id                 = aws_subnet.public-subnet-3a.id
  user_openvpn                  = "user-1"
  routing_ip                    = "172.31.0.0/16"

  tags = {
    Terraform = "Yes"
  }
}
```
### Complete EC2-OpenVPN
For more configurations, you can use the complete example below:
```hcl
module "ec2-openvpn" {
  source = "rizkiprass/ec2-openvpn-as/aws"

  name                   = "Openvpn Access Server"
  ami_id                 = "ami-05b5a865c3579bbc4"
  instance_type          = "t3.micro"
  key_name               = ""
  vpc_id                 = aws_vpc.vpc.id
  ec2_subnet_id          = aws_subnet.public-subnet-3a.id
  user_openvpn           = "user-1"
  routing_ip             = "172.31.0.0/16"
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.openvpn-sg.id]
  iam_instance_profile   = aws_iam_instance_profile.ssm-profile.name

  root_block_device = [
    {
      volume_type = "gp3"
      volume_size = 100
    },
  ]

  tags = {
    Terraform = "Yes"
  }
}
```
## How to Connect to OpenVPN Access Server

1. After successfully deploying the OpenVPN Access Server module, log in to your server using SSH or any other method. (login as: ubuntu)

2. Once you are logged in, navigate to the following location to find the OpenVPN Access Server user admin credentials:
`/home/ubuntu/user-admin-pass.txt`
Open the file to view the username and password for the OpenVPN Access Server admin.

</div>

3. For additional users, you can find their credentials at the following location: `/home/ubuntu/user1-password.txt`
4. Download the OpenVPN Connect application if you haven't already. You can get it from the official OpenVPN website by clicking [here](https://openvpn.net/client/client-connect-vpn-for-windows/).

5. Once the OpenVPN Connect application is installed, open it on your device.

6. To import the OpenVPN profile, follow these steps:

    a. Click on the "+" icon in the OpenVPN Connect application to add a new profile.

    b. Enter the URL of your OpenVPN Access Server. The URL should be in the following format, replacing `<your ip public ec2>` with the public IP address of your EC2 instance: `https://<your ip public ec2>`

    c. Click "Add" to import the profile.

</div>

7. You will be prompted to enter the username and password that you obtained in step 2 for the OpenVPN Access Server admin.

8. Once you've entered the admin credentials, the OpenVPN profile will be imported, and you will be connected to the OpenVPN Access Server.

9. Now you can access your private network securely through the OpenVPN connection.

That's it! You are now connected to your OpenVPN Access Server, and your data is encrypted and transmitted securely. If you encounter any issues, double-check your credentials and the URL you entered in the OpenVPN Connect application.

Follow below step to edit configuration of the openvpn:
10. Login to openvpn admin using https://16.78.138.43:943/admin
Enter username and password. You can find the username and password at step no 2
